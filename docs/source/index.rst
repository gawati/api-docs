Welcome to the Gawati API documentation!
===========================================

The API documentation for Gawati is aggregated on this site. This is 
different from the `Gawati Documentation <https://docs.gawati.org>, as this
document is the API documentation of the code, largely auto-extracted from the
source code.

The documentation is organized into sections based on the included modules:

* :ref:`setup-and-deployment` - APIs related to setup and deployment

.. _setup-and-deployment:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :caption: Setup and Deployment APIs
